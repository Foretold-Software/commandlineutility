**Project Description**

The Command Line Utility is a tool used to enable the fast and easy creation of settings classes that interface directly with the input from the command line. The Command Line Utility performs all the parsing and conversion operations required to turn command line input into class property values. Using the utility, your settings classes will be simple, easy to read and understand, and require very little coding to configure.
